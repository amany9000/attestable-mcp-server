# Attestable MCP Server
<div align="center">

<strong>Attestable Model Context Protocol Server</strong>
</div>

## Overview

This project contains an [MCP Server](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/) that is remotely attestable by MCP clients. To achieve this, a trusted execution environment is used, allowing the MCP server to generate a certificate it can present to an MCP client that proves the code it's running is the same code available on github. The protocol used for client <-> server remote attestation is [RA-TLS](https://cczoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Solutions/rats-tls/index.html), an extension to TLS that adds machine and code specific measurements that can be verified by an MCP client.

The most important concept behind this RA-TLS certificate is that it embeds an [SGX quote](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/public/us/en/documents/intel-sgx-dcap-ecdsa-orientation.pdf) in the standardized X.509 extension field with the [TCG DICE "tagged evidence" OID](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/DICE-Certificate-Profiles-r01_pub.pdf), which in turn embeds the SGX report and the complete Intel SGX certificate chain. In addition to the SGX quote, the certificate also contains the evidence claims, with the most important one being the "pubkey-hash" claim that contains the hash of the ephemeral public key (in DER format) generated by the running MCP server.

<strong>Features</strong>
- MCP Clients can remotely attest the code running on any MCP Server
- MCP Servers can optionally remotely attest MCP Clients
  
## Dependencies
 - Intel SGX Hardware
 - Gramine
 - python 3.13
 - Ubuntu 22.04
 - Intel SGX SDK & PSW
   
## Quickstart

```
uv sync
docker build -t attestable-mcp-server .
gramine-sgx-gen-private-key
git clone https://github.com/gramineproject/gsc docker/gsc
cd docker/gsc
uv run ./gsc build-gramine --rm --no-cache -c ../gramine_base.config.yaml gramine_base
uv run ./gsc build -c ../attestable-mcp-server.config.yaml --rm attestable-mcp-server ../attestable-mcp-server.manifest
uv run ./gsc sign-image -c ../attestable-mcp-server.config.yaml  attestable-mcp-server "$HOME"/.config/gramine/enclave-key.pem
uv run ./gsc info-image gsc-attestable-mcp-server
```

## Starting Server on Secure Hardware
```
docker run -itp --device=/dev/sgx_provision:/dev/sgx/provision  --device=/dev/sgx_enclave:/dev/sgx/enclave -v /var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket:/var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket -p 8000:8000 --rm gsc-attestable-mcp-server
```

## Starting Server on local development machine
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm gsc-attestable-mcp-server
```
## Future Plans

 - JSON Web Key (JWK) attestation claim validation
