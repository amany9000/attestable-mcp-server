<strong>Attestable Model Context Protocol Server</string>
</div>

## Overview

This MCP server is remotely attestable using Attestable TLS. The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction. This Python SDK implements the full MCP specification, making it easy to:

- MCP clients can remotely attest the code running on any MCP server
- Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
- Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts and tools
- Use standard transports like stdio and SSE
- Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events

## Installation
